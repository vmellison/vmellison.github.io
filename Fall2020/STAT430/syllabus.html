<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Course Goals</font></b></span> <br />

<p>This will be an applied course in unsupervised learning. This course will survey some of the most commonly used clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction algorithms currently used by data scientists. Students will apply these algorithms to real and artificial datasets in Python. </p>

In this course we will do the following.
<ul>
  <li>Learn a series of tools (algorithms) that allow us to <b>discover</b> and <b>describe hidden insights</b> contained in <b>high-dimensional unlabeled data</b>.</li>
  <li>Specifically given <b>real-world data sets</b>, students should be able to code a <b>full unsupervised learning analysis</b> in <b>Python</b>. This includes the following.
  	<ul>
  		<li>Be able to justify <b><u>when/if</u> it is useful</b> to use a clustering algorithm or dimensionality reduction algorithm for a given dataset, research question, and reserach scenario.</li>
  		<li>Be able to justify <b><u>which</u></b> clustering and/or dimensionality reduction <b><u>algorithms</u> are most appropriate to use</b> for a given dataset, research question, and research scenario.</li>
  		<li>If the clustering and/or dimensionality reduction algorithm has different settings/parameters that can be utilized, be able to justify <b><u>which parameters to use</u></b>  </li>
  		<li>Be able to justify the <b>evaluation metric(s)/methods</b> that were used to: a.) select which algorithm/model/parameters to use as well b.) describe the nature of the results.</li>
  		<li>Be able to <b>interpret</b> the results of the algorithms and <b>effectively communicate</b> as many hidden insights as possible about the dataset.</li>
  		<li>Be able to understand how different aspects of <b>data pre-processing</b> might affect the results of the unsupervised learning algorithms.</li>
  		<li>Be able to use these unsupervised learning insights to help <b>make predictions</b> as well as <b>make good business decisions.</b>
  	</ul>
  </li>
  <li> In general, students should also know the the following.
  <ul>
  	<li>How each algorithm works and the output of each algorithm.</li>
  	<li>How each algorithm evaluation metric works.</li>
  	<li>Develop an intuition for what happens when we apply to these algorithms and evaluation metrics to 2-d datasets.</li>
  	<li>Students should know how to conduct at least one iteration of these algorithms and calculate these evaluation metrics by hand.</li>
  	<li>Students should know how to code these algorithms and evaluation metrics by hand.</li>
  	<li>Students should demonstrate best practices when effectively communicating and presenting data science results. (Ie: titles on graphs, label the axes etc.)</li>

  </ul>
	</li>
  

</ul>

<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Prerequisites</font></b></span> <br />
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/math/">MATH415 Applied Linear Algebra</a>: Some algorithms will involve knowledge of:

<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Course Section</font></b></span>


<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Lectures</b></span></h3>


    <ul>
	    	<li><strong>Synchronous Lecture Option </strong>: Visit our Compass page for <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_52671_1&tool_id=_2918_1&tool_type=TOOL&mode=view&mode=reset">Zoom links</a> for the synchronous lectures held on</br> <span style="color: #3366ff;"> TuTh 6:30pm-7:50pm CST</span>.</li>
		<li><strong>Asynchronous Lecture Option </strong>: <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_52671_1&content_id=_4625430_1&mode=reset">Videos of the synchronous lecture</a> will be recorded and posted shortly after the lecture on our Compass page.</li> 
	</ul>

		You aren't *required* to attend the synchronous lecture, but you're *encouraged* to attend if you can make it though. Attending lecture at a fixed time will provide you with the opportunity to learn and ask questions from the instructor, the TAs/CAs, and your classmates.

</br></br>


<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Course Materials</font></b></span> <br />

<ul>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Laptop Computer</strong>: You need a laptop running Windows, OS X, or Linux.  Tablets, Chromebooks, and iPads are not supported.  You will need to be able to install Python to complete the labs (instructions provided).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lecture notes</strong>: These will be posted on the course website. Each new day's lecture notes should be available by 8AM CST at the latest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Online Books</strong>: For an introductory-level overview of the concepts and algorithms that we will discuss in this course, the chapters below can be useful resources. However, given that data science is a modern and ever-changing field that is built upon the trial and error of current data scientists, we will be supplementing these base resources with more applied/current papers describing best practices and applied tips as well. Check back here as the semester progresses (or on the course schedule) for more useful resources.
    </br>

    <b>Important Note:</b> You will only be expected to know content that was covered in the lectures or assignments. (So we will not necessarily test you on ALL content that is described in these resources. But if you would like a different resource/way that explains the concepts that we discuss in this course, I would suggest taking a look at these resources first. If you're still confused on a topic, I can try to refer you to a different resource if you ask.)

<p>Bonus points:</p>
<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Homework Assignments</font></b></span> <br />
There will be twelve homework assignments each worth 30 points that will be given during the semester as we cover the corresponding material. The lowest two homework scores will be dropped. Homework must be turned in through Compass on the due dates (see schedule) by 11:59pm CST.
</br></br>
<b>How to submit homework:</b>
<ul>
	<li>All homework assignments should be submitted on Compass.</li>
	<li>All homework assignments will involve coding in Python. You should submit your code in an ipynb.
	<li>Some homework assignments may required you write out some of your answers by hand. Please scan(or take a picture of) these documents and submit them on you Compass assignment as well. (There are many scanner apps that you can download on your smartphone. Please let me know if don't have the appropriate technology to submit these and we can work something out.)</li>
	<li>Please clearly mark and number the questions that you are answering in your code and scanned documents.</li>
</ul>

</br>

<b>Late Policies:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Homework that is late by 5 minutes up to 24 hours will be deducted 30 points.</li>
	<li>Homework that is late by more than 24 hours will receive 0 points.</li> 
</ul>

</br>

<b>Regrade Policies:</b>
You have ONE week to request a grade correction after a homework score is posted. You should clearly present the following information to the head TA (Rong Tang, <a href="mailto:rongt3@illinois.edu">rongt3@illinois.edu</a>):
<ul>
<li> Which homework is involved (e.g. Homework #6)</li>

<li> A detailed explanation of the suspected error</li> 

<li>The number of points you feel you should have received for the question.</li>
</ul>




<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Projects</font></b></span> <br />
A project will be due near the end of the semester that concerns a topic covered by the course or an advanced topic that was not covered. These could include novel software packages in R that we didn’t use in class, or they may involve a deeper look at the methods, or simply be an analysis of an especially interesting dataset.


</br></br>

<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Grades</font></b></span> <br />



<p>The final course grade will be based on the total number of points earned by a student on the homework assignments (max 300) and the project (max 100), for a total of 400 possible points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homework Assignments  - 300 pts</li>
  <li>Final Project - 100 pts total</li>
</ul>

<p>Course points will be translated into a course grade at the end of the semester. The grade thresholds will be based on your percentage score out of 400:</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Participation</b></span></h3>

<p>If you are able to, we encourage you to attend the synchronous class and open labs. Being present will help you keep up with what is going on, gain hands on experience in learning activities, and benefit from interacting with other students and instructional staff. If you are unable to attend the lecture, the expectation is that you will watch the lecture video within 24 hours of it being posted. If you are unable to attend the labs and have content questions, please ask them on Piazza!</p>

<p>Please ask questions whenever anything is confusing. If you find errors in the notes, please report them to the instructor. The instructor will be very happy that you detected them so they can be corrected!</p>


<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Learning Collaboratively</font></b></span> <br />

</br>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Using the Breakout Rooms</b></span></h3>

<p>	While we can't all see eachother on campus this semester, we want you to collaborate and form connections with your classmates in the class :)
	<ul>
    <li><b>Pre-Assigned Breakout Rooms</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>To make sure that you're automatically assigned to your breakout room, make sure that you sign onto the Zoom lectures using this method described below.
        <ul>
          <li>Create an Illinois Zoom Account. IF you have not done so already, do the following steps. You only need to do this once.
            <ul>
              <li>Go here <a href="https://illinois.zoom.us/">https://illinois.zoom.us</a> (using Google Chrome or Firefox).</li>
              <li>Click on 'sign in' to configure your Zoom Illinois account.</li>
              <li>Sign in with your netid and password.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
              <li>Before, logging into the meeting, make sure you are signed into your zoom program on your computer with your Illinois credentials. See instructions <a href="https://answers.illinois.edu/96159#_ga=2.115608390.1929590727.1597106835-662679821.1596482734">here</a> for how to do this.</li>
              <li>Go to the 'Zoom Meeting' tab in Compass and click on <b>'STAT430 - Synchronous Lectures'</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
		<li><b>Forming Breakout Room Groups</b> 
			<ul>
				<li>In the survey that I sent out at the beginning of the semester, I asked if there are any students that you know in the class that you would like to be in a breakout room with.</li>
				<li>If you didn't specifically request anyone to be in your breakout room, then during the first two weeks of class I will randomly assign you to different breakout rooms each lecture, so you can meet new students in the class that you might not know.</li>
				<li>After the first two weeks of class, I will make semi-permanent group assignments (of 3-4 people) for anyone who hasn't specified a desired group at that point.</li>
        <li>If at anytime during the semester (including the first two weeks), you decide you'd like to be in a fixed breakout room group with one or more students, send the head TA (Rong Tang <a href="mailto:rongt3@illinois.edu">rongt3@illinois.edu</a>) an email (with their names) and we will make that assignment.</li>
        <li>If at anytime during the semester (including the first two weeks), there is someone you would NOT like to be in a breakout room with me, send the Dr. Ellison (<a href="mailto:vellison@illinois.edu">vellison@illinois.edu</a>) an email (with their names) and we will make that assignment.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Getting to Know Your Classmates</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Feel free to log in 10 minutes early if you'd like to chat with your classmates that are in your breakout room or ask me a question before class.</li>
			<li>Feel free to stay logged in 10 minutes after the lecture to chat with your classmates that are in your breakout room or ask me a question after class. (The TAs/CAs and I will not go into the breakout rooms unless you request for us).</li>
		</ul>

	</ul>
</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss all of your course activities (with the exception of exams) with your friends and classmates!  You will learn more though talking through the problems, teaching others, and sharing ideas.</p>

<p>Continue to read on “Academic Integrity” to understand the difference between collaboration and giving an answer away.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Academic Integrity</b></span></h3>



<p>Collaboration is about working <strong>together</strong>.  Collaboration is <strong>not</strong> giving the direct answer to a friend or sharing the source code to an assignment.  Collaboration requires you to make a serious attempt at every assignment and discuss your ideas and doubts with others so everyone gets more out of the discussion  Your answers <strong>must</strong> be your own words and your code must be typed (not copied/pasted) by you.</p>

<p>You may discuss basic concepts with other students, but your document should be completed on your own without evidence of having viewed another student’s solutions.</p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is taken very seriously in STAT 430 and all cases will be brought to the University, your college, and your department. You should understand how academic integrity applies specifically to STAT 430: the sanctions for cheating on an assignment includes a loss of all points for the assignment and that the final course grade is lowered by one whole letter grade (70 points).  A second incident, or cheating on an exam, results in an automatic F in the course.</p>

<p>Academic integrity includes protecting your work.  If you work ends up submitted by someone else, we have considered this a violation of academic integrity just as though you submitted someone else’s work.</p>


<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Email Note</font></b></span> <br />
Given that this course is completely online, please check your email regularly for important class communications. 
<br /><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>COVID-19 Note</font></b></span> <br />
Given the uncertain nature of how this semester might unfold due to COVID-19. The instructor reserves the right to make any changes she considers academically
advisable. Such changes, if any, will be announced in class. Please note that it is your
responsibility to attend the class and keep track of the proceedings.

However, we will try to adhere to this syllabus and course schedule as much as possible, and will send an email informing you of any changes.
