<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Syllabus</font></b></span> <br />

<p>Building on the foundation of STAT 107, Data Science Discovery, we use Python, Jupyter notebooks, and GitHub to explore data science techniques, statistical concepts, and data analytic workflows, combined with the statistical analysis of STAT 200. (STAT107 is not technically required for this course.) As we explore data science we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop understanding of probability models for noisy data and how these translate into uncertainty analysis and statistical inference</li>
  <li>Understand how modeling assumptions and sampling frames affect our conclusions</li>
  <li>Become adept with multiple regression modeling, basic machine learning, and inference</li>
  <li>Become proficient in Python coding for data management, analytics, visualization</li>
  <li>Understand and use GitHub repositories, the industry standard for submitting code and reports</li>
</ul>

<p>Prerequisites: None. Students who completed STAT 100 or 107 previously are welcome. Equally welcome are students in quantitative fields taking STAT 200 as their first course in statistical analysis. The early programming will comprise an accelerated introduction for those who did not take STAT 107 prior and a quick review for those who did. You will receive course credit and Quant I or Quant II credit for STAT 200 while participating in the launch of Data Science Exploration!</p>

	</ul>

		You aren't *required* to attend the synchronous lecture, but you're *encouraged* to attend if you can make it though. Attending lecture at a fixed time will provide you with the opportunity to learn and ask questions from the instructor, the TAs/CAs, and your classmates.

<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Course Assignments and Grades</font></b></span> <br />

<p>Course grades are computed based on your percentage out of 650 points for the course.  The components are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homework Labs  - 250 pts</li>
  <li>Midterm Exams - 200 pts total</li>
  <li>Final Exam - 200 pts</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 650 pts</p>

<p>Bonus points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Any homework/lab points above 250 (total possible for 10 out of 12) will be added to bonus points, up to 50 bonus points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project - Up to 50 bonus pts</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Final Course Grade</b></span></h3>

<p>Course points will be translated into a course grade at the end of the semester. The grade thresholds will be based on your percentage score out of 650:</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Participation</b></span></h3>

<p>If you are able to, we encourage you to attend the synchronous class and open labs. Being present will help you keep up with what is going on, gain hands on experience in learning activities, and benefit from interacting with other students and instructional staff. If you are unable to attend the lecture, the expectation is that you will watch the lecture video within 24 hours of it being posted. If you are unable to attend the labs and have content questions, please ask them on Piazza!</p>

<p>Please ask questions whenever anything is confusing. If you find errors in the notes, please report them to the instructor. The instructor will be very happy that you detected them so they can be corrected!</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Late Submissions</b></span></h3>

<p>No late submissions are accepted.  However, it is only necessary to complete 10 of 12 labs to achieve full credit.</p>

<span style="color: #339966;"><font size="6"><b>Learning Collaboratively</font></b></span> <br />

</br>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Using the Breakout Rooms</b></span></h3>

<p>	While we can't all see eachother on campus this semester, we want you to collaborate and form connections with your classmates in the class :)
	<ul>
		<li><b>Pre-Assigned Breakout Rooms</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>To make sure that you're automatically assigned to your breakout room, make sure that you sign onto the Zoom lectures using this <a href="https://answers.illinois.edu/96159#_ga=2.115608390.1929590727.1597106835-662679821.1596482734">method</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Forming Breakout Room Groups</b> 
			<ul>
				<li>In the survey that I sent out at the beginning of the semester, I asked if there are any students that you know in the class that you would like to be in a breakout room with.</li>
				<li>If you didn't specifically request anyone to be in your breakout room, then during the first two weeks of class I will randomly assign you to different breakout rooms each lecture, so you can meet new students in the class that you might not know.</li>
				<li>After the first two weeks of class, I will make semi-permanent group assignments (of 3-4 people) for anyone who hasn't specified a desired group at that point.</li>
				<li>If at anytime during the semester (including the first two weeks), you decide you'd like to be in a fixed breakout room group with one or more students, send me an email (with their names) and I will make that assignment.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Getting to Know Your Classmates</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Feel free to log in 10 minutes early if you'd like to chat with your classmates that are in your breakout room or ask me a question before class.</li>
			<li>Feel free to stay logged in 10 minutes after the lecture to chat with your classmates that are in your breakout room or ask me a question after class. (The TAs/CAs and I will not go into the breakout rooms unless you request for us).</li>
		</ul>

	</ul>
</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss all of your course activities (with the exception of exams) with your friends and classmates!  You will learn more though talking through the problems, teaching others, and sharing ideas.</p>

<p>Continue to read on “Academic Integrity” to understand the difference between collaboration and giving an answer away.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b>Academic Integrity</b></span></h3>



<p>Collaboration is about working <strong>together</strong>.  Collaboration is <strong>not</strong> giving the direct answer to a friend or sharing the source code to an assignment.  Collaboration requires you to make a serious attempt at every assignment and discuss your ideas and doubts with others so everyone gets more out of the discussion  Your answers <strong>must</strong> be your own words and your code must be typed (not copied/pasted) by you.</p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is taken very seriously in STAT 207 and all cases will be brought to the University, your college, and your department. You should understand how academic integrity applies specifically to STAT 207: the sanctions for cheating on an assignment includes a loss of all points for the assignment and that the final course grade is lowered by one whole letter grade (70 points).  A second incident, or cheating on an exam, results in an automatic F in the course.</p>

<p>Academic integrity includes protecting your work.  If you work ends up submitted by someone else, we have considered this a violation of academic integrity just as though you submitted someone else’s work.</p>
